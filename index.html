        <iframe class="imgbox"src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AmS2-9KEeS0"></iframe>
   
    <p class="stxt"> Multi-paradigm programming is programming that enables distinct styles of programming to be implemented
        whether individually or blended together. Programming languages on the other hand, are categorized
        according to their paradigms such as imperative, functional and object-oriented.
        C++ is a multi-paradigm language because programmers are permitted to combine parts of programming
        approaches such as procedural programming or object-oriented programming.</p>

       <h5 class="stxt">Three
           Criteria of Programming Paradigms in C++</h5>
 
    <p class="stxt"><b>1. Imperative Programming in C++</b><br>
        C++ is an imperative programming language that supports imperative paradigm.
        Imperative programming paradigm is one of the oldest programming paradigm and was developed
        using machine-languages.  A program based on this paradigm is made up of a <b>clearly-defined sequence of 
        instructions</b> to a computer. Therefore, the source code for imperative languages such as C++ is a series of commands,
        which specify the operations that the computer must complete to reach its final goal. The program describes steps 
        that change the computer's state of memory by providing statements. The state is represented by program variables
        where the values used in variables are changed at program runtime.</p>
     <!--example-->
    <h3 class="stxt">Example :</h3>
        <img class="imgbox3" src="https://imgur.com/xMIpIUO.png" alt="Imperative Example" style="height: 25vw;">     
    <h3 class="stxt">Advantages & Disadvantages of Imperative Programming</h3>
    <div class="content">
        <b>Advantages:</b>
        <li>I. Very simple to implement</li>
        <li>II. It contains loop</li>
        <li>III. Code is easy to understand</li>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <b>Disadvantages:</b>
        <li>I. Complex problem can not be solved </li>
        <li>II.Higher risk of errors when editing </li>
        <li>III. Parallel programming is not possible</li>
    </div>
    <br><br>
   
    <p class="stxt"><b>2. Functional Programming in C++</b><br>
        Functional progamming paradigm is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing
        functions. It is a <b>declarative programming</b> paradigm in which emphasize the definition of function that
        return a value, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which change the state of the program. C++ is not a functional 
        programming language but it is a multi-paradigm programming language that <b>supports functional style programming</b>.</p>
        
        
     <p class="stxt"> Functional programming in C++ allows creation of STL algorithm - a set of common algorithm pattern such as sorting and counting which allow 
        to pass custom functions without resorting to function pointers. The capability to pass functions as arguments to another function, 
        and to have functions that return new functions, made even the first standardized version of C++ a functional programming languages.
        The functional features of the languages are introduced in C++11 standard. Only the C++ compiler which supports the above standard can compile 
        and run the code.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <b>Advantages:</b>
        <li>I. Program are stateless</li>
        <li>II. Well-suited for parallelization</li>
        <li>III. Easily testable and debuggable</li>

    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <b>Disadvantages:</b>
        <li>I. Data cannot be changed </li>
        <li>II. Type safety often lacking </li>
        <li>III. Limited to mathematical abstractions </li>
    </div>

    <br><br>
  
   
    <p class="stxt"><b>3. Object-oriented Programming in C++</b><br>
        Object-oriented programming is a programming style that uses object to implement the real world entities like 
        <b>inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction</b> and more in programming. The main aim of Object-oriented programming is 
        to bind the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function. In C++ languages,
        the building block that leads to Object-oriented programming is a <b>Class</b>. It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and 
        member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an object or instance of that class. A Class in C++ is a <b>blue-print</b> representing 
        a group of objects which shares some common properties and behaviours. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated
        where an object is created, memory is allocated.</p>

        <b>Advantages:</b>
        <li>I. Code is reusable</li>
        <li>II. Ensure data security</li>
        <li>III. Code is easy to maintain</li>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <b>Disadvantages:</b>
        <li>I. It can cause duplication</li>

    <br>
    <div class="sectionbox">
   
        <p class="stxt"><b>Readability</b><br>
            In the readability criteria, C++ language can be evaluated by analyzing at their overall simplicity, orthogonality, 
        data types and syntax design. The overall simplicity of this language can be found in their multiplicity of its features. 
        There are many possible ways could be implemented by developers in performing a particular operation. For example, there can
        be four operations in performing an increment which are i = i +1, i+= 1, i++ and ++ i. C++ also allows overloading of user-defined 
        operators which may cause confusion as a single operator symbol that may have more than one meaning. Though overloading may improve 
        readability, it may also be harmful to readability. For example, ampersand (&) in C++ has entirely different meanings in unary 
        like (& a) and binary (a & b) operators. </p>
        
    <p class="stxt">The syntax design for naming a variable in C++ are case sensitive but the length limit of the variable name is not specified. 
        It is important for programmers to make sure that the chosen name must be easier to understand. For example, RegisterDate is
        much easier to read compared to RDate. For the data type, there are presence of adequate facilities for defining the data type.
        For instances, in Boolean expression, value can be defined as numeric data types or other data type. This flexible can be aided to readability 
        for example, flag = true is much easier to read compared to flag = 1 which sometime make it an unclear statement. </p>    
     <!--example-->
        
   
    <br><br>
     
   
        <p class="stxt"><b>Writability</b><br>
            Writability is a measure of how easily a language used to create programs for a specific problem. Many of the language characteristics 
        which affect readability can affect writability. C++ language have a variety of data type that help the process of creating and writing a program become easier. 
        The ability to define certain code as function and can be reused the code by just calling the function. For example, we can create sorting function that the function 
        can be called whenever we need to sorting a list. C++ is also a tool for abstraction since it is an object-oriented language that improve its writability. Abstraction 
        in object-oriented language means that it has encapsulation and data hiding which allows classes to be developed and thus this would be its way of encapsulation data 
        as objects. The C++ language also supports data hiding with a public, private, and protected keyword that allows users to allocate their data to a particular position
        in their coding. Its shows that C++ successfully support abstraction</p>
        
        
 <!--example-->
  
    <br><br>
        
        <p class="stxt"><b>Realiability</b><br>
            Reliability of C++ language can be measure from its capability to perform its specifications under all condition.  The testing that can be perform to measure 
            the language reliability are type checking, exception handling, aliasing and its readability and writability. Type checking is the process of verifying and enforcing 
            the constraints of types, and it can occur either at compile time or at runtime. Type checking ensures that the program is type-safe, meaning that the possibility of 
            type errors is kept to a minimum. Exception handling is the process of responding to exceptions when a computer program runs. An exception occurs when an unexpected event 
            happens that requires special processing. C++ provides a robust exception handling mechanism that uses blocks of attempt and can catch runtime errors, fix the problem and 
            continue the program. This handling of exceptions increases its reliability.</p>
        
        <p class="stxt">Aliasing refers to the situation where the same memory location can be accessed using different names. In C++, it allows aliasing which means two or more distinct referencing names used to access the same memory cell. 
            This may decrease the reliability of the program but it is for increasing the efficiency and flexibility of the program. For instances, the statement int i = 7 and int *j = &i 
            are both refer to the same memory cell. The program's reliability can be improved by the better readability and writability. C++ language is close to another language, either in
            terms of its syntax or language that make improve its readability and writability. In C++, it is capable of supporting the common ways of expressing an algorithm which does not need 
            the use of unique approaches. For example, the syntax is quite similar to java language. Both use ‘main’ function as an entry point when the execution begins and the data types used 
            are for both are very similar.</p>
 <!--example-->
  
    <br><br>
    
   
    <p class="stxt"><b>Cost</b><br>
        The total cost of a programming language is a function of numerous of its characteristics. To evaluate cost in C++ language there are many factors that we need 
        to be ensured which include training, writing programs, compiling programs, executing programs, language implementation system, poor reliability and also its maintenance
        C++ language have a lot of features that make it difficult to be learned. The learning process may take a long period to learn the features for a new programmer. However, 
        C++ has a very straightforward syntax that’s make its readability and writability is fair. A lot of training cost in using C++ language can be reduce if the new programmer 
        already learned C language because the C language have almost same like C++ language.</p>
        
    <p class="stxt">Currently, the cost of compilation and execution programs reduces because C++ has inexpensive compilers and its uses compiler implementation method. The cost of 
        executing programs written in C++ language is influenced by the design language, which are emphasizes the flexibility, efficiency and productivity 
        that does not require a run time type check to speed up the execution code. However, C++ consider as relatively unreliable. In C++, it may increase some cost to 
        ensure greater reliability and maintaining programs which are includes corrections and modification in adding a new functionality. But, by increasing reliability 
        and adding new features other  cost can be reduced. For example, by adding new features in certain part, we can increase the system execution speed 
       and improve its maintainability. This show that the total cost of C++ is fair and can be accepted</p>
